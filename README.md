# hello-world

Hey there! 

I'm Gerardo! I want to get into programming. I always have since I was in high school but never had any proper guidance. 
I know a lot of technical things such as repair and very familiar with technology in general but not programming. 
Theres a certain thing about finding the solution to a tech problem that keeps me at it for hours. I don't understand it but maybe it was the training I had with music since I was younger, but I can go into that a different time Self discipline. 

                                                                                            11/17/2018 3:38 AM
